Little changes to your daily routine can collectively make a big difference in
environmental issues. Sometimes one striking fact or statistic is all it takes
to motivate people to make small (or big) but consistent changes in their
day-to-day habits.

greenismy.life is a project by Carly Dovale, Kevin Ernst, Harrison Stanley, and
Alexus Wimbus for Dr. Crowley's spring 2016 course entitled "Humans and
Nature: Living in the Anthropocene" (ANTH2040).
