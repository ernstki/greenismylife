The amount of uranium to produce the energy needs for one human lifetime was
computed using the following assumptions:

$$
\frac{313 \textrm{ million BTU}}{\textrm{person} \cdot \textrm{year}} =
    91,731 \textrm{ kWh}
$$

over an average lifetime of 78 years.

<!--
$$
\frac{\mathrm{kWh}}{\mathrm{yr}} \cdot \textrm{life expectancy} =
    \textit{energy usage for a human lifetime}
$$

And given that 1 ton of uranium yields **40 million kWh** of energy, 1 lb of
uranium yields **20,000 kWh** of energy.
-->

From information on [this page][anl1] at Argonne National Labs'
site, we find out that one pound of uranium forms a ball 1.3 inches in
diameter, somewhat smaller than size of a golf ball (1.68 inches in diameter).

Since the EPA estimates of 313 million BTU/person-year are for Americans (and
Americans rank very high in the [per-capita energy use among all nations][wp1]
on the planet), we assume that the average human requires significantly less,
and this is how we arrive at the figure on the flyer.
