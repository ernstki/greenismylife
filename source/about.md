## Premise
Little changes to your daily routine can collectively make a big difference in
environmental issues. Sometimes one striking fact or statistic is all it takes
to motivate people to make small (or big) but consistent changes in their
day-to-day habits.

[greenismy.life](/) is a project by Carly Dovale, Kevin Ernst, Harrison
Stanley, and Alexus Wimbish for Dr. Crowley's spring 2016 course entitled
"Humans and Nature: Living in the Anthropocene" (ANTH2040).

## Messages

* Buy local
* Eat less meat; switch to a vegetable-based diet
* Bike more
* Recycle
* Increase support for low-carbon energy sources like nuclear

## Intended Audience
General public of all different education levels (not just college students),
random passers-by in markets and bars.

## Format
Single-page flyers with one concise message. An eye-opening statistic like the
number of chickens killed every year, or the number of tons of coal (or
thousands of metric tons of emissions) that would be saved by producing power
from 1 g of U-235?

These are intended to inform people quickly about environmental topics,
potentially giving them the opportunity to make better decisions in their daily
lives.
